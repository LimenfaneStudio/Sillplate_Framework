# Sillplate Framework

The Sillplate Framework is a Java framework for programming general applications and 2D video games for desktop x64 PC platforms. The goal of this Framework is simplicity, ease of use, and syntactic uniformity, exposing all the features present in core Java necessary to create applications/games in a single, intuitive code style.

A sill plate is a horizontal beam placed at the base of a wall where it attached to the foundation of a building.

The Sillplate Framework is an ongoing project of Limenfane Studio, and is used as the base for all my other video game development projects. See my home page at limenfanestudio.com for updates on this and other projects.
